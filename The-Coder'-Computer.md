# Chose my text editor

**Brackets is a free text editor that’s available for download for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. It’s made and maintained by the good folks at Adobe—yep, the Photoshop people. Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, though more coding capabilities can be added through extensions. Being that Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this might be a great choice to start with. But still the choice is yours. Brackets includes all of the features one may want when using a text editor including something called “Live Preview” which updates your website once you make a change automatically. So, you can’t go wrong with Brackets.**

# Opening a Terminal
*Opening a terminal is fairly easy. I can't tell you exactly how to do it as every system is different but here are a few places to start looking.
•	If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
•	If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
•	If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .*

## Everything is a File
Ok, the first thing we need to appreciate with linux is that under the hood, everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc. To begin with, this won't affect what we do too much but keep it in mind as it helps with understanding the behaviour of Linux as we manage files and directories.
