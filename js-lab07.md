How JavaScript  makes web pages more interactive:
1- ACCESS CONTENT You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example:
 • Select the text inside all of the elements on a page
 • Select any elements that have a c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
 • Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of ema i .
2- MODIFY CONTENT You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:
 • Add a paragraph of text after the first element
 • Change the value of c 1 ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
 • Change the size or position of an element.
3- PROGRAM RULES You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:
 • A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
 • A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a ca lculation, and display repayments. 
• An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport).
4- REACT TO EVENTS You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when: 
• A button is pressed 
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on •
 A cursor hovers over an element
 • Information is added to a form 
• An interval of time has passed 
• A web page has finished loading

#  A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps. 
1: DEFINE THE GOAL First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.
 2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart. You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task (and any information it needs to perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it can follow. 
3: CODE EACH STEP Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the compu ter understands. In our case, this is JavaScript. As tempting as it can be to start coding straight away, it pays to spend time designing your script before you start writing it.

EXPRESSIONS
there are two types of expressions.
1-EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
var color = 'beige';
2-EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
var area = 3 * 2;

WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
